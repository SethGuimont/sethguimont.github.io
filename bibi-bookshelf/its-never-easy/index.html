	<p class="block_"><span class="text_"></span><span class="text_1">It’s Never Easy</span></p>
	<p class="block_1"></p>
	<p class="block_2">Hank looked down with an odd sense of surrealism. Staring at the machine gun in front of him. It was finally time to put all the plans into action, but it was odd that he was here now. Time was funny like that. Tomorrow if everything went well this would be just another odd moment he could put away with the rest. Like a bad day at work, or a visit to the dentist. It wasn’t something you wanted to do. It just had to get done. Still actually being in the warehouse getting ready to go through with it felt off. </p>
	<p class="block_1"></p>
	<p class="block_2">“Red you ok”, Jimmy asked him. “Don’t tell me you're having second thoughts now.” </p>
	<p class="block_1"></p>
	<p class="block_2">It took him a second to remember they were supposed to be using their code names. Jim, or Smoke as he called himself, thought it would be a good idea to get used to it. That way no one used real ones by accident during the heist. Still made him feel like a dumbass though.</p>
	<p class="block_1"></p>
	<p class="block_2">“Nah just thinking about whether we were going to need all this shit. It's heavy.” He picked up the metal beast in front of him and looked down the sights. “That and I don’t like the idea of seeing what this thing would actually do to a person.” For the four entering the bank they had modified swat armor, with extra protection and black bulletproof masks. On top of that he had two extra clips, tear gas, a sledge hammer, an industrial drill, binds and gags, a flare gun, a pistol with another two extra clips, a radio system with earpiece, duffle bags, a utility knife, and because Bones wouldn’t shut up about it a survival kit complete with medical supplies.</p>
	<p class="block_1"></p>
	<p class="block_2">“Yea I get it, nobody here wants that. We just can’t rule it out. The armor is rated for anything the cops can throw at us. So we should be fine even if it comes to that. Just keep your head straight and everything will be ok. As far as the drill, you're really the only one big enough to carry it.”</p>
	<p class="block_1"></p>
	<p class="block_2">It was true Red was big, six foot five with a face that screamed I am a criminal. He had always looked that way though. In truth, he had been an engineer. Still would be if the company hadn’t laid him off during a merger. He had some savings to rely on for a while, but a motorcyclist hit him in a crosswalk giving him a nasty knee injury. It was a hit and run, and since he no longer had insurance the medical bills were too much to keep up with. Going from safe to rock bottom was scary. Scary enough to make <span class="text_2">a few bad decisions.</span> It was funny how everything fell into place so well, or rather so poorly. If it wasn’t for Thomas, Hank wasn’t so sure he would have made it through prison. He always felt like he still owed him. It was the only reason he was even here. </p>
	<p class="block_1"></p>
	<p class="block_2">“You keep saying that, but you know being big doesn’t inherently make me strong. Bones actually works out. I don’t know why you think my fat ass is tougher than his.” <span class="text_3">Who says this?</span></p>
	<p class="block_1"></p>
	<p class="block_2">“Because it is. Now stop whining and grab your shit. Oh also Bones got antsy so he started painting the face masks. He wanted to know what you wanted for yours.”<span class="text_3"> Who says this?</span></p>
	<p class="block_2"></p>
	<p class="block_2">Red grumbled, and started grabbing his protective gear. As he started strapping everything on he headed towards Bones. Passing by the semi truck they would be riding in he watched Dust checking the engine for the fifth time.</p>
	<p class="block_2"></p>
	<p class="block_2">“Gee Dust you think it's ok yet.” <span class="text_3">Who says this?</span></p>
	<p class="block_3"></p>
	<p class="block_2">The overweight middle aged woman looked more like a bus driver than a getaway driver. “Oh go eat a fat one Red. I just want this to be over. Now fuck off and let me make sure were not all fucked if you fuck something up.”</p>
	<p class="block_3"></p>
	<p class="block_2">Dust, or Marry if you wanted to use her real name, had always been easy to anger. She had been a truck driver for years so she knew the roads well. It's why Jim offered her the job. They had worked with her once before robbing a couple semi trucks. She knew where they parked and how much shit you could grab before the companies actually started to care. </p>
	<p class="block_3"></p>
	<p class="block_2">“Well fucking fuck Dust I guess I’ll go.” Red smiled as Dust flipped him the bird. He laughed, and walked over the bench Bones was working on.</p>
	<p class="block_3"></p>
	<p class="block_2">Bones had headphones in and was finishing up on what Red assumed was his own mask. He assumed this because it was a skull. Everything bones wore always had skulls on them. Holding in the sigh of disapproval was hard, but bones was one of those guys that didn’t mind having the same argument two dozen times over, even when he was wrong. While it was entertaining, listening to him furiously defend that he didn’t have the fashion sense of a highschooler the first five times. It was getting just a little old. </p>
	<p class="block_3"></p>
	<p class="block_2">As he got closer Bones looked up, “Hey Red what do want on your mask.”</p>
	<p class="block_3"></p>
	<p class="block_2">“Hmmm How about a clown.”</p>
	<p class="block_3"></p>
	<p class="block_2">“A clown?’’, Bones said in a dry tone.</p>
	<p class="block_3"></p>
	<p class="block_2">“Yea like one of those scary carnival ones.”</p>
	<p class="block_3"></p>
	<p class="block_2"><span class="calibre1">Bones stared at him for a second, “You sure you want a clown? I can paint just  about anything on these.”</span></p>
	<p class="block_3"></p>
	<p class="block_2">“”Yea I’m sure. I want a clown face.”</p>
	<p class="block_3"></p>
	<p class="block_2">There was an awkward silence “But that’s so cliche how about-”</p>
	<p class="block_3"></p>
	<p class="block_2">“Bones! You just finished drawing a skull on yours and you're going to complain to me about being cliche.” </p>
	<p class="block_3"></p>
	<p class="block_2">“But that's my thing man. I’m Bones, of course I’m gonna have a skull.”</p>
	<p class="block_3"></p>
	<p class="block_2">“Well I like clowns, it even has a <i class="calibre2">Red</i> nose, so why is it so hard for you to draw a fucking clown.”</p>
	<p class="block_2"></p>
	<p class="block_2">“Yea but I was thinking about a whole four horsemen of the apocalypse thing since there are four of us.”</p>
	<p class="block_3"></p>
	<p class="block_2">“Then why did you bother asking me what I wanted if you were just gonna shoot it down. Also how does a skull play into that.” </p>
	<p class="block_3"></p>
	<p class="block_2">“It's death obviously.”</p>
	<p class="block_3"></p>
	<p class="block_2">“No, I'm not playing into this. You drew a skull and then thought about other stuff that <i class="calibre2">you</i> thought would look cool next to a skull. You are either going to draw me the best damn clown you’ve ever drawn, or I’m just going to erase whatever you put on there.”</p>
	<p class="block_2"></p>
	<p class="block_2">“It’s paint dumbass, you can’t erase paint.”</p>
	<p class="block_2"></p>
	<p class="block_2">“Then I’m going to paint over your skull.” Red grabbed a spray can to show he meant business. </p>
	<p class="block_2"></p>
	<p class="block_2">Bones’ face froze in quiet contemplation. He weighed his options. Red mentally prepared to talk him down again. Chances were that this could go on for a while. Usually Red was ok with just letting Bones have his way with the small stuff, but the stress made this easier to think about. He’d rather have this stupid pointless argument with his friend, than have to think about what might happen to them later. </p>
	<p class="block_3"></p>
	<p class="block_2">Just as Bones was going to start up again Smoke walked over. “Red, go check on Hatchet.” Hatchet was Thomas’ codename. “Bones when you finish up I want you to grease the guns again. We can’t risk anything being out of place.” Bones rolled his eyes. He had already greased the gun, but Jim always got this way when he was nervous. Everything had to be perfect.</p>
	<p class="block_3"></p>
	<p class="block_2">“Yeah boss, I got it. Oh hey, what did you want on your mask?”</p>
	<p class="block_3"></p>
	<p class="block_2">“Leave mine blank. It will make it easier to recognize me.” </p>
	<p class="block_2"></p>
	<p class="block_2">“I guess that makes sense. It’ll give that no-nonsense leader kinda vibe?”</p>
	<p class="block_3"></p>
	<p class="block_2">Smoke tried to smile at the sentiment. You could tell the stress was getting to him. It wasn’t like they were professional thieves or anything. It was just a group of desperate friends. “Sure something like that.” </p>
	<p class="block_3"></p>
	<p class="block_2"> Red looked back at Bones, and pointed his finger at him. “It better be a clown.” Smoke stared at Red like he was crazy. Red just smiled.</p>
	<p class="block_2"></p>
	<p class="block_2">With that, he walked off to check on Hatchet. Which ended up being much harder than it should have been. He was usually fucking around with the audio equipment, or shooting the shit with Dust. He wasn’t in the bathroom. It took three times around the whole warehouse and ten confused looks from everyone for him to finally check outside, which of course meant taking off all the gear he had just put on. Can’t wander around outside in riot gear or someone might call the cops. As he fought one of the knee pads, Hatchet slammed the door only a foot away from Red’s face.</p>
	<p class="block_2"></p>
	<p class="block_2">Hatchet’s eyes were puffy and red. Tears still stuck to his cheeks. Combining that with the startled reaction he had from Red being there, only made it worse. He turned away immediately, trying to hide his face.</p>
	<p class="block_2"></p>
	<p class="block_2">“Fucking shit Hank,” his voice was shaking. “You trying to scare me half to death? The hell are you even doing here.” </p>
	<p class="block_2"></p>
	<p class="block_2">“<span class="text_4">Jimmy</span> sent me to come get you,” Red took a deep breath. He wasn’t sure if it would be the right choice but he had to ask. “Was it the hospital again?” </p>
	<p class="block_2"></p>
	<p class="block_2">“Yea,” <span class="text_4">Thomas</span> said, even that one word was a struggle for him. Coughing on the flem building up in his throat. He tried to speak again but choked on his words. It killed <span class="text_4">Hank </span>to see him this way.</p>
	<p class="block_2"></p>
	<p class="block_2">“They said,” <span class="text_4">Thomas </span>had to stop himself before it broke him. The words hurt him more than he wanted them too. “They said that in her condition it might be better to spend more time at the hospital.” He couldn't bear to look <span class="text_4">Hank </span>in the eyes. So instead he stared holes into the wall next to him. “ How do you do that to someone? Tell them to give up and watch the person you care about most die.” <span class="text_4">Thomas </span>paused, his face sombering. “The worst part is when I think maybe they’re right. What if it’s not enough? What if everything goes off without a hitch. We get the money. I get back and she’s dead. Even if I’m able to get her on the waiting list. It might not be enough. What should I do then?”</p>
	<p class="block_2"></p>
	<p class="block_2">“You can’t ask me that Thomas. I’m just trying not fuck up my own life more than it already is. We can try. That’s really about it, and if it doesn't work. If everything goes to hell. Every plan gone to waste. Then at least we can say we did what we could. I don’t know. If we make it out alive somehow, ask me again. Maybe then I’ll be able to come up with something better.”</p>
	<p class="block_2"></p>
	<p class="block_2">Hatchet chuckled, which was a good sign. “Man, what an uplifting pep-talk. I can’t think of anything to make you feel better, oh also we might die.”</p>
	<p class="block_2"></p>
	<p class="block_2">“Well of course it sound sounds stupid when you say like that.” They laughed at the situation for a minute. It really did seem silly that two men getting ready to rob a bank would be talking like this. </p>
	<p class="block_2"></p>
	<p class="block_2">“Ugh, I should probably rinse my face off or something.”</p>
	<p class="block_2"></p>
	<p class="block_2">Red got up and started heading back. “I’ll grab your mask.” Hatchet thanked him for the sentiment. Walking back Red almost had to laugh at himself again. If he could make it through <span class="text_3">that</span>, this heist should be a piece of cake.</p>
	<p class="block_2"></p>
	<p class="block_2">A little later as they were packing things up into the semi Red couldn’t help but look back at Hatchet. Bones had painted a devil onto his mask. It was haunting how well it paired with bloodshot eyes. It almost looked like it had been done on purpose. Smoke was talking to him before they left. He could imagine how it was going without having to hear them. Smoke would try to be sympathetic, poorly. Hatchet would lie and say that he’s fine. The conversation wouldn’t ultimately accomplish anything by the end. Just leave everyone that much more uneasy. </p>
	<p class="block_2"></p>
	<p class="block_2"><span class="text_4">Hank </span>felt bad for putting everything on <span class="text_4">Jimmy</span>. Everyone always expected him to know what to do. He always looked calm and collected, but he just existed like that. They talked alot about getting away from legally questionable methods of obtaining money. It was hard to get a job with a criminal record. Jim wanted to use the money from the job to try and start a business of his own <span class="text_3">doing what?</span>. So he could hire his friends, and fix their problems. Problems he shouldn’t of had to worry about in the first place</p>
	<p class="block_2"></p>
	<p class="block_2">Behind him Bones finished loading up some of the supplies. As he walked back out towards Red he was checking his gun.</p>
	<p class="block_2"></p>
	<p class="block_2">“You think we’ll get to use these things?”</p>
	<p class="block_2"></p>
	<p class="block_2">“The whole point is hoping that we don’t”</p>
	<p class="block_2"></p>
	<p class="block_2">“Ya ya I know, I just think they’re cool. You can’t tell me you never wanted to just take one of these things and let loose on full auto.”</p>
	<p class="block_2"></p>
	<p class="block_2">“If I did I would have just gone to the range.”</p>
	<p class="block_2"></p>
	<p class="block_2">“You know you’re no fun right?”</p>
	<p class="block_2"></p>
	<p class="block_2">“Here gimme a sec.” Red reached down grabbing his mask then putting it on. The clown face on his build screamed psychopath. Something straight out of a horror movie. “Am I funny now?”</p>
	<p class="block_2"></p>
	<p class="block_2">“Good god Red I didn’t think you could get uglier.” They both chuckled at their own bad jokes. </p>
	<p class="block_2"></p>
	<p class="block_2">Smoke yelled from behind them, “Hey! Get a move on, we are on a time crunch here.” When Red turned to face him he shook his head. “Jesus shit bones that thing is gonna give someone a heart attack.”</p>
	<p class="block_2"></p>
	<p class="block_2">Bones cracked a shit eating grin. “Honestly I thought he looked scarier without it.”</p>
	<p class="block_2"></p>
	<p class="block_2">“Just be ready. I want to be able to leave the second Clarissa gives us a call.”</p>
	<p class="block_2"></p>
	<p class="block_2">“Guns are good, I’ve checked 'em three times. If I oil them again they are gonna start leaking the stuff. Dust has been doing nothing but checking the car. Everyones has their gear on, and me and Red just finished loading up the truck. Anything else you need.” </p>
	<p class="block_2"></p>
	<p class="block_2">“Yea go check the radio equipment. Then be ready to go.”</p>
	<p class="block_2"></p>
	<p class="block_2">It didn’t take long after that. They got the call that it was time and started moving out. All of them but Dust were riding in the back. They would get to the bank and wait for a sign to move in. </p>
	<p class="block_2">Clarrisa was a disgruntled bank manager. Really the only reason any of this was possible. Red had been having nightmares where Clarrisa chickened out. That when they got there the semi doors would swing open to a police set up. </p>
	<p class="block_2"></p>
	<p class="block_2">In truth the plan sounded ok. The truck was painted as a maintenance vehicle. It would park right in front of the bank. A machine they rigged together would create smoke and loud noises, like the truck had a broken engine to deter people from coming close, and to drown out any noise from inside. Clarrisa would disable the alarm. Then come outside to apologize for the inconvenience of being closed to anyone trying to make it in.</p>
	<p class="block_2"></p>
	<p class="block_2">They had talked about doing it at night, but Clarrisa could only <i class="calibre2">disable</i> the security system by scheduling a maintenance reset during hours. She had been putting in complaint requests all month to get her security company to actually do it. It also only gave them an hour window to get things done.</p>
	<p class="block_2"></p>
	<p class="block_2">“Should almost be there guys, get ready. This is all gonna go smoothly. We're gonna be in and out, then be on with the rest of our lives.” Smoke wasn’t really the best at speeches. Still it would be nice to get this over with.</p>
	<p class="block_2"></p>
	<p class="block_2">You could tell they had hit the city. The truck stopped moving as much, and you hear more commotion outside. Swaying back and forth in the dark while nervous was starting to make Red sick. Seconds seem like hours. It was getting hot and he was tired of sitting already. </p>
	<p class="block_2"></p>
	<p class="block_2">Hatchet tried making small talk. “So has anyone been watching the news lately? Apparently there’s been a big commotion about a cover up on food quality.”</p>
	<p class="block_2"></p>
	<p class="block_2">“The one with the rotten produce?” Bones confirmed.</p>
	<p class="block_2"></p>
	<p class="block_2">“Yea, that's the one. Companies trying to pass off expired shit as food. Now they're trying to say it's fine cause they only do it in <i class="calibre2">safe</i> quantities, and that they’ve been doing it for years. That the only reason people have been getting sick off the shit now is because of the meat shortage. That the change in diet is what's doing it. </p>
	<p class="block_2"></p>
	<p class="block_2">“So their defense is that it was fine when people weren’t actually eating our food. I swear people will do anything these days to make a buck off others.” Bones always had a funny way of saying shit that was a little too on the nose. </p>
	<p class="block_2"></p>
	<p class="block_2">Smoke just laughed. “Yea I suppose they do Bones.”</p>
	<p class="block_2"></p>
	<p class="block_2">“Wait but what we're doing is totally different. The whole idea is that we taking money from people like that, so-” </p>
	<p class="block_2"></p>
	<p class="block_2">There was finally a banging on the truck door. No one realized the truck had actually stopped. Everyone just kind of assumed they were still in trafic. It was time. </p>
	<p class="block_2"></p>
	<p class="block_2">“Check your guns. Red you and me are in front. Let's go.” Smoke was really to get this over with</p>
	<p class="block_2"></p>
	<p class="block_2">Two doors on the side of the truck opened up to allow them into the bank without being seen. They filed in quickly, guns raised and laser sights on to show exactly where they were pointed. No one wanted to be a hero if they realized they were going to be the first one shot. The bank was mostly one large room. Normally natural light would fill the room from the large glass walls surrounding the front doors. Currently there was a truck in front of them. Teller lines had attendants already attempting to sound an alarm. They didn't know it was turned off. Cubicles were off to the side, anyone near dove behind them, as if the cheap plywood walls would somehow protect them from bullets. A single security guard stood dumbfounded as he realized how pointless his existence had just become. Red’s laser sight pointed straight at his head.</p>
	<p class="block_2"></p>
	<p class="block_2">“Everyone listen up and calm down.” Smoke yelled at the top of his lungs. The sound of the engine behind them blasting away. It gave an odd muted feel to the situation. Red motioned the security guard to get on the floor. Bones covered the door, while Hatchet ran towards the back to make sure no one was hiding anywhere else. </p>
	<p class="block_2"></p>
	<p class="block_2">“Here is how things are going to work. Everyone is going to huddle up in front of the teller lines. You are going to lay down and stay there till we are done. My friend is going to relieve everyone of their phones. If I see anyone trying to be a hero, then everyone is going to have problems. We are not here to take hostages. We are not here to hurt you. But! That is only if everything goes according to plan.”</p>
	<p class="block_2"></p>
	<p class="block_2">Smoke was lucky that his voice carried a very calming tone. Even while yelling he didn’t really seem angry. Surprisingly everything <i class="calibre2">was</i> actually going to plan. Walking over to the guard Red was easily able to grab his gun. There was little to no resistance from most of the people in the bank. For some reason Red just didn’t expect things to go this well. Guess Smoke’s paranoia was rubbing off on him. </p>
	<p class="block_2"></p>
	<p class="block_2"><span class="calibre1">Red  zip tied the security guard and anyone else that looked like they might cause trouble. Afterward Bones and Smoke dragged them over to the teller line. </span></p>
	<p class="block_2"></p>
	<p class="block_2">Heading back to the safe with Hatchet, Red tried his best to just accept that it might actually be this easy. While Hatchet entered the password, Red got the drill ready. Clarrisa gave them the code to the vault, but they would have to drill open the safety deposit boxes. </p>
	<p class="block_2"></p>
	<p class="block_2">It was odd again. After drilling several of the boxes open his anxiety just kinda died off. You can only freak out for so long I suppose. Now it was just like doing any other menial task. Hatchet was quiet as he packed the money into bags. The noise of the drill seemed to meld with the noise of the engine after a while. His arms started to tire. </p>
	<p class="block_2"></p>
	<p class="block_2">“Hey Hatchet.”</p>
	<p class="block_2"></p>
	<p class="block_2">“What?’</p>
	<p class="block_2"></p>
	<p class="block_2">“Take over for a sec. I need a break.”</p>
	<p class="block_2"></p>
	<p class="block_2">Hatchet shrugged and grabbed the drill. The money that wasn’t in the boxes had already been baged so there wasn’t really much else to do at the moment. Red walked the bags they had out to Bones and Smoke. Smoke looked at Red and used the radio to communicate.</p>
	<p class="block_2"></p>
	<p class="block_2">“Why aren’t you inside drilling.”</p>
	<p class="block_2"></p>
	<p class="block_2">Red just yelled over the noise. </p>
	<p class="block_2"></p>
	<p class="block_2">“My arms were tired.” </p>
	<p class="block_2"></p>
	<p class="block_2">Smoke just shook his head and went back to moving bags. Red arched his back and heard something pop (<span class="text_3">his back</span>). He felt stupid for wearing all this heavy gear if this was going to be this easy. His knee was starting to act up from all the weight. He looked at the civilians and felt bad for them. The stupid painting Bones gave him was likely not helping. Why did he have to ask for a clown?</p>
	<p class="block_2"></p>
	<p class="block_2">Red noticed a bowl of candy next to him in the teller line. He reached over and grabbed several and shoved them under his mask into his mouth. They were chocolate mints. Red hated these, but the sugar made him feel better. He had a habit of eating when he was stressed. The people next to him started like he was some sort of animal. </p>
	<p class="block_2"></p>
	<p class="block_2">“Red are you going to take this back or what.” Hatchet asked over the radio. </p>
	<p class="block_2"></p>
	<p class="block_2">“Fuck YeEah om comMon.” Red yelled back with a mouth full of mints. He grabbed the mints and tossed them down to civilians. Maybe they could cheer someone else up too. </p>
	<p class="block_2"></p>
	<p class="block_2">Red walked back to the vault. When he entered Hatchet threw the drill at him.</p>
	<p class="block_2"></p>
	<p class="block_2">“Fuck that thing is heavy. Look at this though.” Hatchet held up a gold bar.</p>
	<p class="block_2"></p>
	<p class="block_2">“Holy shit. When Clarrisa mentioned gold I thought she was talking out her ass.”</p>
	<p class="block_2"></p>
	<p class="block_2">“Yea well it just means there is that much more for all of us. Now help me finish the rest of the boxes.” </p>
	<p class="block_2"></p>
	<p class="block_2">Smoke interrupted on the radio. “Hatchet, get out here now. I need you for something.”</p>
	<p class="block_2"></p>
	<p class="block_2">Red worried. “Is everything alright?” </p>
	<p class="block_2"></p>
	<p class="block_2">“Hopefully just finish up as quick as you can, Red.”</p>
	<p class="block_2"></p>
	<p class="block_2">Red and Hatchet exchanged worried looks. Going back to his work Red tried not to think about the worst case scenario. Everything was fine. The sound of the drill seemed much louder as it peeled away at the metal of the lockbox. </p>
	<p class="block_2"></p>
	<p class="block_2">Smoke was on the radio again. “Red fuck it. Grab what you can, we are leaving right now.” </p>
	<p class="block_2">His arms couldn’t possibly move fast enough. Picking up every bag and the drill just seemed a slow and arduous task. Running back into the lobby everything seemed fine. There were no cops or sirens, just the rest of his team. It had gotten darker outside. </p>
	<p class="block_2"></p>
	<p class="block_2">“What's going on Smoke?”</p>
	<p class="block_2"></p>
	<p class="block_2">“Don’t worry we heard some gun shots off in the distance, but I don’t think they have anything to do with us. I just don’t want to be here when cops are driving by. Just get that shit in the truck.” </p>
	<p class="block_2"></p>
	<p class="block_2">Then every single phone in the bank went off. Making a siren noise. The four of them paused looking around in confusion. Smoke started reaching into the bag of phones to see what was going on. Then Dust ran inside a ski mask on her face. </p>
	<p class="block_2"></p>
	<p class="block_2">“They’re telling everyone to get inside and to take cover.” </p>
	<p class="block_2"></p>
	<p class="block_2">Everyone in the bank began to panic. Smoke fired a round into the ceiling.</p>
	<p class="block_2"></p>
	<p class="block_2">“HEY! None of that. We just opened the vault so you can all stay there.” He looked at Dusk, angry that she had almost caused a panic. “We are leaving.” </p>
	<p class="block_2"></p>
	<p class="block_2">Red wanted nothing more than that. For them to just be able to leave. The power cut. The crowd screamed once more. </p>
	<p class="block_2"></p>
	<p class="block_2">Smoke yelled out with his gun raised. “It's gotta be the cops. Bones keep your gun pointed at the doors. Hatchet, you watch the hostages. Red get the bags ”</p>
	<p class="block_2"></p>
	<p class="block_2">The room was dark. The sudden silence was somehow more deffening than the noise. There was something uncomfortable about being able to hear yourself breathe. The only light was the slivers of the window not obstructed by the truck. Red knew it wasn’t the cops. He wished it was. He would probably surrender at this point. </p>
	<p class="block_2"></p>
	<p class="block_2">“Smoke.” Red said in a shaky voice.</p>
	<p class="block_2"></p>
	<p class="block_2">“WHAT?”</p>
	<p class="block_2"></p>
	<p class="block_2">“The Truck turned off.” </p>
	<p class="block_2"></p>
	<p class="block_2">You could hear people outside confused. Screaming in the distance. Not a single car engine could be heard. Smoke thought about that and lowered his weapon. He checked his radio and found it was dead. Along with anything else that ran on electricity. He looked at Red.</p>
	<p class="block_2"></p>
	<p class="block_2">“No. God no. Get everyone in the vault now. Cut the ties and see if we can get it shut without electricity.”</p>
	<p class="block_2"></p>
	<p class="block_2">Bones looked confused. “What do you mean the car’s off? What's going on?’</p>
	<p class="block_2"></p>
	<p class="block_2">“Don’t worry Bones just get it done”. Red wasn’t about to explain to Bones how fucked their situation just became. Maybe by some miracle of god Red was wrong, but there weren’t many things that caused an electromagnetic pulse large enough to kill all of the electronics in a large area. The only thing he could think of was a nuclear bomb. </p>
	<p class="block_2"> </p>
	<p class="block_2">Outside Red heard what he feared might be an explosion. Scared some of the people in the bank were already running to the vault. Red listened but the sound was off. It wasn’t a boom. It was more like a crash. Then another and another. Red backed away from the door. This didn’t make sense. Then there was screaming. You could hear people outside running from something. The cries for help. A gunshot rang out followed by more screams. The lack of electronics made it uncomfortably easy to hear everything.</p>
	<p class="block_3"></p>
	<p class="block_2">Then it happened. A creature jumped up onto the hood of Dust’s truck. It squeezed through an opening. It crawled in through the open door. Everyone couldn’t help but stare in awe at the thing before them. It was covered in black, gnarled fur that was dripping some sort of oily liquid. All of its skin either looked too loose or too tight, like it didn’t fit right. Standing on all eight of its long emaciated looking legs. Its body was almost shaped like a crocodile with a larger chest that slunk close to the ground. Its feet ended in what looked like four elongated disturbing human looking fingers. The head was the most concerning. It looked like someone tried to stretch skin over a hornless deer skull. Six pupiless milky white eyes littered each side. Along with a mouth filled with jagged sharp teeth. Teeth that were stained red with blood. </p>
	<p class="block_2"></p>
	<p class="block_2">The creature chattered its bony jaw. Slammed its front legs into the ground then charged one of the civilians. The man screamed as the creature rushed him. He tried kicking it but the creature caught his foot in its mouth. Wrenching violently the creature took off the man's shoe alone with a good portion of the skin on his leg. The room screamed in unison only to be drowned out by the sound of a gunshot.</p>
	<p class="block_2"></p>
	<p class="block_2">Smoke put a round into the side of the creature. It fell and made a noise almost too faint to hear. It was breathy and high pitched, a little painful on the ears. Another creature squeezed underneath the truck. Smoke shot the one on the ground to quiet it then turned the one under the truck.</p>
	<p class="block_2"></p>
	<p class="block_2"> Red stared at the creature smoke had shot. The way it was writhing seemed all too natural for the abomination that he was looking at. It's almost humanoid hands grabbing for the air that it couldn’t find. Its blood, just like anything else, was red. He needed it to stop. He walked towards it without thinking and took out his pistol. Red winced as he fired the gun. Somehow watching the viscera paint the ground behind the creature's skull did not make him feel any better.</p>
	<p class="block_2"></p>
	<p class="block_2">“RED! FUCKING HELP!” </p>
	<p class="block_2"></p>
	<p class="block_2"><span class="calibre1">Red’s head snapped back toward the door and his stomach sank. Ants, it was the only thing he could compare it to. The black hands reached out from every crack not covered by the truck that now seemed like it was trapping them in. The way they crawled in. How their mouths bit at the air. It was like ants swarming at scraps of food left on the floor. Smoke and Bones didn’t stop shooting. There were so many they could barely squeeze through the door. The creatures were already cracking one of the glass walls, while  Hatchet was trying desperately to free a security guard from his bindings, and he stared like a deer in the headlights.</span></p>
	<p class="block_2"></p>
	<p class="block_2"><span class="calibre1">Red grabbed his gun and dropped to the floor. From here it only looked worse. Now he could see more under the truck. He didn’t bother aiming. There wasn’t really a need for it. Pulling back  on the trigger everything else was dominated by the deafening roar of the bullets being vomited forth from the machine he held. The creatures were torn to shreds as the hail metal crashed into them. Draggin the gun back and forth, Red cleared the bottom of the truck. Then Red heard a noise that robbed him of any confidence that this action had inspired in him. A dull metal Click. </span></p>
	<p class="block_2"></p>
	<p class="block_2">Bones yelled down at him, “PUT IT ON SINGLE FIRE YOU DUMBSHIT.” His words sounded hollow. Red’s ears were still ringing. </p>
	<p class="block_2"></p>
	<p class="block_2">Red’s stunt only saved them a couple seconds before more hands reached from under the truck. The creatures digging and biting through fellow corpses just to get to them. Hatchet grabbed his belt for anything that might help, and found a tear gas canister. He was so panicked he pulled the pin and tossed at the door just hoping it would help. </p>
	<p class="block_2"></p>
	<p class="block_2">Smoke took notice and yelled. “GET BACK AND COVER YOU FACES!” </p>
	<p class="block_2"></p>
	<p class="block_2">The canister hissed and white mist sprayed into the entrance. The creatures hissed and recoiled. Red fussed with his gun trying to reload it while he had the time. Smoke helped Hatchet get people back to the vault. Bones was still shooting whenever a creature tried to brave its way through. The man attacked was bleeding profusely and crying for help.</p>
	<p class="block_2"></p>
	<p class="block_2">“Where is Dust,” Bones yelled. </p>
	<p class="block_2"></p>
	<p class="block_2">“She headed back to the Vault,” Red responded. Honestly he couldn’t really blame her.</p>
	<p class="block_2"></p>
	<p class="block_2">“Doesn’t she have a shotgun.”</p>
	<p class="block_2"></p>
	<p class="block_2">“She left it in the car.”</p>
	<p class="block_2"></p>
	<p class="block_2">“For fuck sake.” </p>
	<p class="block_2"></p>
	<p class="block_2">Hatchet came back to grab the man on the ground. As he got closer to him he started coughing. The tear gas was starting to permeate into the bank. Red eye’s felt like they were burning. Bones started moving away from the door to avoid it, but Hatchet had still been standing too close because he was trying to save someone.</p>
	<p class="block_2"></p>
	<p class="block_2">The front door exploded. The mist scattered along with glass and debris. Whatever had been making the crashing noises outside smashed into the truck in front of the bank. It had knocked it just enough to make a large opening. Dim light flooded into the bank along with a hoard of the terrifying creatures. The mist had been dispersed enough they no longer cared. </p>
	<p class="block_2"></p>
	<p class="block_2">Bones dove behind the teller line. Red wanted to run. But there was nowhere to go. He raised his gun and fired. The hail of bullets only momentarily slowed the wave of creatures pouring in. Hatchet turned his eyes still stinging from the gas he sprayed at them blindly, but he was just too close. One of the things barreled into him. It’s jaw clamped on his thigh. Arms grabbed at anything for leverage with which to tear better. Red watching the monster’s head wrenched back with fresh flecks of blood tossed into the air. A well placed shot from Smoke brained the thing, and it collapsed onto Hatchet. </p>
	<p class="block_2"></p>
	<p class="block_2">“THOMAS!” Red’s voice was barely audible to even himself.</p>
	<p class="block_2"></p>
	<p class="block_2">Red continued to try and thin the crowd of creatures down as he backed himself towards Smoke. He tried to shoot around where Thomas was, but he was terrified he might miss and shoot him. His best friend might be dead right now, and he couldn’t do anything about it. The monster’s spread into the room and started grabbing and attacking anyone they could reach. People were trampled by the things as the creatures climbed over each other to find prey of their own. Smoke thrust the security guard's gun back into his hands. Anyone who could help needed to. </p>
	<p class="block_2"></p>
	<p class="block_2">Smoke was directing people best he could, but it was a madhouse. He watched one of the things bolt past him and rip out the neck of someone using their body to shield their friends. Bullets just weren’t killing them fast enough. </p>
	<p class="block_2"></p>
	<p class="block_2">Hackest’s flare gun went off. The room was washed in bright orange light. The creatures didn’t understand what was happening and snapped at the light, several even ran. It wasn’t much. Just enough for people to be able to see they had stopped pouring in. That there was a finite amount of them. Bones planted his tear gas into the middle of the crowd to break them up.</p>
	<p class="block_2"></p>
	<p class="block_2">Red laid down another spray of bullets. It was hard to tell when one of the things was even dead. Another flare burst, Smoke had fired his as well. Past the pain and hopelessness Red realized there were only a few left. It was hard to tell when it had happened. The line between endless and only a handful was blurry. He took aim and tried to conserve bullets now that he might actually need them later. Ten left, then seven, then seemingly none. Red took a deep breath and lowered his gun as the last two ran out the door. </p>
	<p class="block_2"></p>
	<p class="block_2">Was it over? He heard crying. It had likely been happening the whole time but he heard it. People were finally able to recognise the pain they were in. The screaming didn’t stop even though the creatures were dead. Smoke was still in high gear. He ran to the vault to see if any of the creatures had made it inside. Bones was still watching the door for more of those things. Red raced over to where Hatchet was. </p>
	<p class="block_2"></p>
	<p class="block_2">A pained moan let him know he was still alive underneath the pile of dead creatures. Red rolled them off him, then paused as he looked at the condition his friend was in. Their right leg was bleeding profusely from where the creature bit him. It was also mangled from the weight of the things stomping over him. It looked broken along with several fingers on his left hand that were bent backwards. His breathing was labored, and blood was running down from his mask, still painted with a devil’s face. Red almost burst to tears on the spot. It felt like someone was squeezing his insides. </p>
	<p class="block_2"></p>
	<p class="block_2">“Thomas, it's ok. You are going to be ok. BONES HELP ME! I NEED A MEDKIT!”</p>
	<p class="block_2"></p>
	<p class="block_2">Bones ran over. His eyes visibly went wide under his mask. </p>
	<p class="block_3"></p>
	<p class="block_2">“Hank we can’t-”</p>
	<p class="block_3"></p>
	<p class="block_2">“SHUT UP AND HELP HIM! We need to stop the bleeding. Then we can make a splint for his legs.”</p>
	<p class="block_2"></p>
	<p class="block_2">Thomas coughed and grabbed Hank’s arm. “Mask please.” His voice labored and gurgled from the blood.</p>
	<p class="block_3"></p>
	<p class="block_2">Red was already applying pressure to the leg. He removed the mask from friends face. Blood filled his mouth. It was a bad sign. His mind raced to think of what he could do to stop a punctured lung.</p>
	<p class="block_2"></p>
	<p class="block_2">“H-Hank it's over. She’s dead Hank. She died the second the lights went out, and now it’s my turn to finally be with her. Like I should have been before.”</p>
	<p class="block_2"></p>
	<p class="block_2">The realization hit Red hard. Tears running down his face under the mask. No electricity meant no life support. </p>
	<p class="block_3"></p>
	<p class="block_2">“We don’t know that. They could be ok. <i class="calibre2">You’re</i> going to be ok. That was the whole fucking point. That's the only reason I even came here.”</p>
	<p class="block_2"></p>
	<p class="block_2">Hands trembling, Hank’s hand slipped hitting the broken leg he was trying to fix.</p>
	<p class="block_2">“FUCK! Thomas I’m so sorry.” </p>
	<p class="block_3"></p>
	<p class="block_2">“It’s ok Hank. I can’t feel them anyway.” </p>
	<p class="block_3"></p>
	<p class="block_2">It finally hit him. Thomas was dead. He was dead, and he knew it. Hank could see it on his face. </p>
	<p class="block_3"></p>
	<p class="block_2">“Bones,” Thomas coughed. “Could I bum one last cigarette.” Bones tried to respond and coughed on his words. He nodded, pulling one out to light it, his hands struggling not to shake. Handing it over Thomas all he could say was, “I’m sorry”.</p>
	<p class="block_3"></p>
	<p class="block_2"><span class="calibre1">“It's ok, we tried.” Thomas put  his cigarette to his lips and breathed in. He struggled to cough. The air refused to come back out. His face was already so pale. He seemed to relax, his arm falling to his side. The cigarette was extinguished by his own blood. Cigarette smoke still seeping from his lips.</span></p>
	<p class="block_3"></p>
	<p class="block_2">Bones got up shaking his head in disbelief. “I'm going to find Smoke. He’ll know what to do.” He might as well have been talking to himself. Red was unresponsive. Knowing there was nothing he could say that would help, Bones ran off. </p>
	<p class="block_2"></p>
	<p class="block_2">Red just sat there staring at his friend. Almost expecting him to get back up. He didn’t want to let it be real. It seemed like the world had stopped. He wanted it to. He wanted everything to stop. He needed time more than anything. Time to grieve. Time to rest. Time to watch the bits of smoke dissipate from the last breath of his best friend who had died right before his eyes. It could never have lasted long enough.</p>
	<p class="block_2"></p>
	<p class="block_2">“ALRIGHT EVERYONE LISTEN UP,” Smoke yelled. Dust, Bones, and several other people including the bank security guard stood behind him. It made him look like he was in control. People looked to them in hope for answers, for anything. “We can’t hold up here with the door busted open. The bank vault is also stuck open without electricity so we can’t hold up in there either. There is an old apartment complex a couple blocks down the road. It has its own water tower, small easy to defend hallways, and supplies from the people who live there. If we are lucky they may even have a doctor who lives there. If you’re not injured, help carry someone who is. If we have any extra hands, grab anything you can to defend yourselves. We are leaving in ten minutes.”</p>
	<p class="block_2"></p>
	<p class="block_2">Everyone started talking over each other. Crying and yelling to get attention. A woman pleaded that her husband couldn’t survive the trip. Another person said it would be safer to stay where they were. An older man declared he wasn’t taking commands from criminals. </p>
	<p class="block_2"></p>
	<p class="block_2">Bones leveled his rifle, firing several rounds over the crowd. Behind them another creature had wandered into the building. </p>
	<p class="block_2"></p>
	<p class="block_2">“I’m just letting everyone know where the people who actually brought guns are going. If you wanna stay, stay. Anyone who's still trying to live, follow us.”</p>
	<p class="block_2"></p>
	<p class="block_2">People continued yelling over each other as Smoke started preparing. He was right. They couldn’t stay. Smoke had enough people around him that no one would try to start something. He always had everything so well planned out. His group walked over, and Smoke knelt down next to Red. </p>
	<p class="block_2"></p>
	<p class="block_2">“I’m sorry Red, we need to leave. We have to grab his gear. Hatchet would want-”</p>
	<p class="block_2"></p>
	<p class="block_2">“THOMAS! His name was fucking <i class="calibre2">Thomas Jared Anders</i>. The man that god hated. We shouldn’t have been here. I shouldn’t told you to fuck off. You and your fucking plans.”</p>
	<p class="block_2"></p>
	<p class="block_2">Marry saw Thomas’ mangled body. “Oh god Hank I’m sorry, but-”</p>
	<p class="block_2"></p>
	<p class="block_2">“Don’t you start to Marry. You Bitch, your only here because you couldn’t afford fucking child support for kid you abandoned. He was trying to save his wife. He was a good person. So why. Why are we all still alive while he’s dead?” </p>
	<p class="block_2"></p>
	<p class="block_2">Smoke’s eyes look devoid of any emotion whatsoever. “Because he deserved better than this shit world we all still live in. Now get up and get ready. If you wanna die, do it protecting one of them.” He pointed to people from the bank. They hadn’t even noticed his outburst. Too busy with trying to pick themselves up after witnessing that hell. </p>
	<p class="block_2"></p>
	<p class="block_2">Bones pushed Smoke aside. “Give him five fucking minuets man. He just watched his best friend die.” </p>
	<p class="block_2"></p>
	<p class="block_2">“We don’t have five minutes. Hate me later right now if we don’t move more people will die. You hear me Hank. Hate me, I don’t care. Blame me because it's always my fault anyway. I'm sorry we don’t have the time, but we don’t. So get you whiny ass up before you get more people killed.”</p>
	<p class="block_2"></p>
	<p class="block_2">“Jim, that's too far,” Dust said.</p>
	<p class="block_2"></p>
	<p class="block_2"></p>
	<p class="block_2">“No, sadly right now it's not.” Smoke bent down and started taking the gear off of his friend.</p>
	<p class="block_2"></p>
	<p class="block_2">Marry looked at Hank. “He was our friend too, asshole.”</p>
	<p class="block_2"></p>
	<p class="block_2">Hank wanted to rip Jim off of thomas’ body. He wanted to beat half to death, but he was right. It didn’t make it any better. </p>
	<p class="block_2"></p>
	<p class="block_2">As he removed Hackets gear Smoke kept going. “His armor won’t fit Dust so we’ll give it to the security guard. He still has all his extra ammo. Dust you can take his rifle. The guard will get his pistol and the shotgun from the truck. I used most of my ammo so I'm taking one of the clips. Red, Bones how are you doing on ammo.”</p>
	<p class="block_2"></p>
	<p class="block_2">Red looked down at his gun, the large box magazines he used held 100 rounds each. He opened the loading camber of his gun and saw four bullets left of his current box.</p>
	<p class="block_2"></p>
	<p class="block_2">“I'm down to my last box.” He pocketed the last four shots as he reloaded.</p>
	<p class="block_2"></p>
	<p class="block_2">“Single fire only then, Bones how about you?”</p>
	<p class="block_2"></p>
	<p class="block_2">“I had seven more magazines for my rifle and five more for my pistol.” </p>
	<p class="block_2"></p>
	<p class="block_2">Both Red and Smoke turned their heads to look at Bones. </p>
	<p class="block_2"></p>
	<p class="block_2">“Yeah so to be honest I thought for sure we would end up in a firefight with the cops so I brought extra ammo.” </p>
	<p class="block_2"></p>
	<p class="block_2">Smoke shook his head. “Well thank god you did. We might actually survive this. Red you and Bones go get the shotgun from the truck.”</p>
	<p class="block_2"></p>
	<p class="block_2">“Fine,” Red forced his body to stand. His knee was starting to hurt. It was hard to tell if it was from exhaustion or stress, probably both. He and Bones walked to the entrance. Bones climbed over the rubble to grab the gun while Red watched for more of those things.</p>
	<p class="block_3"></p>
	<p class="block_2"><span class="calibre1">Outside it was dark. The clouds that had rolled in looked like they might drop rain on them at any minute. A few of  those things could still be seen in the distance. Cars and corpses littered the street along with another oddity. The crashing had come from large metal devices that had rained down on them. For lack of better words they looked like metal pods. All of them had tubes on the top pointed down in a spiral. Three hatches were left open on all of them. The creatures didn’t just appear. They were dropped in. Hank no longer had the emotional capacity to be amazed by this. It only made him worried that more may drop in. </span></p>
	<p class="block_2"></p>
	<p class="block_2">Bones dropped down from the truck with the shotgun. “Damn, if it wasn’t for the fact that we're probably going to die this would be cool.” He paused to stare at it for a second taking off his mask. His face was covered in sweat and marks from the mask. “Sorry about Thomas. I tried to cover him. There were just too many.”</p>
	<p class="block_2"></p>
	<p class="block_2">“I know. I should have convinced him not to do this. He shouldn’t have been here.”</p>
	<p class="block_2"></p>
	<p class="block_2">“I know you feel that way, but this was going to happen one way or another. If his wife really is dead I don't think he would have wanted to keep living. At least he got to help some people before he died.” </p>
	<p class="block_2"></p>
	<p class="block_2">“I guess that's a nice way of looking at it. Thanks, Bones.” </p>
	<p class="block_2"></p>
	<p class="block_2">“No problem.” Bones reached into one of his pockets and pulled out a bottle of pills. “You want some molly.”</p>
	<p class="block_2"></p>
	<p class="block_2">“Jesus Christ Bones I hate you. I hate you so much I can't even describe it.” </p>
	<p class="block_2"></p>
	<p class="block_2">Bones laughed, “Hey man, we all deal with grief differently. Besides might as well have fun if all going to die in some sort of fucking apocolypse.” Bones popped his pill and headed back inside. </p>
	<p class="block_2"></p>
	<p class="block_2">Red Shook his head. He wondered how much farther his waning care for poor bystanders inside would actually carry him.</p>
	<p class="block_2"></p>
	<p class="block_2"><span class="calibre1">Smoke gathered almost everyone in the bank together. A few too injured or scared decided to stay behind. The security guard that would have been their mortal enemy just a few moments before was now wearing Hatchet's gear.  </span></p>
	<p class="block_2"></p>
	<p class="block_2">“Everyone try to stay huddled together. Call out only if one of those things are charging us. I don’t want to upset them if we don’t have to.” </p>
	<p class="block_2"></p>
	<p class="block_2">Red was watching the rear. He wondered what it must have looked like when it was happening. When the street was still full of people instead of corpses. It all must have happened so quickly. All the shops were dark, the glass in front of them smashed. How many people died? He watched one of the creatures jump up onto a car and stare at them. It turned its head in a very animalistic way to get a better look. Pointing his gun at it he waited to see if it would make a move. Instead it scurried away. He found himself wondering how intelligent these things were. Worrying if it was smart enough to go warn others.</p>
	<p class="block_2"></p>
	<p class="block_2">As the group was passing through an intersection it stopped. Smoke and the others at the front were talking. Bones started climbing up on top of an suv. Red started walking to the front. He could hear the guard and Smoke talking.<span class="text_3"> It bothered Hank to see Thomas’ mask on someone else’s face. </span></p>
	<p class="block_2"></p>
	<p class="block_2">The guard seemed to be arguing with smoke, “ We need to do something.” </p>
	<p class="block_2"></p>
	<p class="block_2">“No, we need to keep moving. There are only five of them, that's not enough to risk getting attacked.”</p>
	<p class="block_2"></p>
	<p class="block_2">Red looked down the road and saw five people running parallel to them on another road. A small horde of those creatures were chasing them. They hadn’t noticed their group.</p>
	<p class="block_2"></p>
	<p class="block_2">Red looked at Smoke. “You can be serious Smoke, what happened to helping people?”</p>
	<p class="block_2"></p>
	<p class="block_2">“Red, get back to the rear, you need to watch for danger.”</p>
	<p class="block_2"></p>
	<p class="block_2">A gunshot interrupted their conversation. Bones was firing on the creatures. </p>
	<p class="block_2"></p>
	<p class="block_2">“Bones! What is wrong with you?” Smoke yelled. </p>
	<p class="block_2"></p>
	<p class="block_2">He waved the group over and continued shooting. “Start moving, I got this.”</p>
	<p class="block_2"></p>
	<p class="block_2">“Damn it Bones, Everyone keep moving.” </p>
	<p class="block_2"></p>
	<p class="block_2">The group was now panicking. Red half expected creatures to start coming out of the woodworks, but the street was still mostly empty. Dust fired at a creature off to their left. It didn’t seem to alert anything. There were just remnants of them wandering around. The apartment was only a little farther. Red looked back. Bones was still waiting on the five to get closer. He was worried another friend was going to die playing hero. Then Bones look back. Something surprised him and he pointed up.</p>
	<p class="block_2"></p>
	<p class="block_2">Red gazed up to the sky and his heart nearly stopped. More of the pods were dropping from the sky. Fire was erupting from the pipes on top of them. It was slowing their descent. Just enough so the monster inside would survive. Red watches one slam into the building above them. Debris raining down.</p>
	<p class="block_2"></p>
	<p class="block_2"> Then pods open as the creatures inside poured out covered in some oily substance. They fell from the pod like rotten flesh falling from bone. One slams into the ground only a handful of feet away from the group. Blood pooling underneath it. The fall had killed it. Several others dropped down next to it. As the group moved a layer of dead creatures was now a cushion for the rest. </p>
	<p class="block_2"></p>
	<p class="block_2">“Fuck move your asses,” Red yell as he started shooting the ones not killed by the drop.</p>
	<p class="block_2"></p>
	<p class="block_2">Another pod crashed only half a block away. Still dealing with the first Red watched more of creatures pour out heads turning to the group. He turned, firing several shots towards the horde. </p>
	<p class="block_2"></p>
	<p class="block_2">Smoke yelled to Red. “Just focus on the back. You need to conserve ammo.” </p>
	<p class="block_2"></p>
	<p class="block_2">He was right. It just felt wrong to watch them close in and not do anything. Dust and the guard tried covering the side as they continued. With little ammo Red was forced to let them get close enough he could hit them. </p>
	<p class="block_2"></p>
	<p class="block_2">Every step back wasn’t happening fast enough. The group was just too big to move efficiently. The injured were also slowing them down. He looked up to check if he could still see Bones. By now he had either moved, or was dead.</p>
	<p class="block_2"></p>
	<p class="block_2">Then Red noticed something. The creatures had stopped charging. They had slowed down. He wondered if they had given up. If only that had been the case. One of the creatures let out a breathy ring from its mouth. Then they all charged together.</p>
	<p class="block_2"></p>
	<p class="block_2">Switching his gun back to automatic Red braced for the worse. His volley of bullets crashed into the charging creatures. Even if every shot had hit it wouldn’t be enough.</p>
	<p class="block_2"></p>
	<p class="block_2">People scattered, some outright dropping the injured to save themselves. Red never stopped shooting. The swarm slowly surrounded his position. A flare from Smoke nearly blinded Red as it landed at his feet. It was likely the only reason the creature hadn’t torn him appart. </p>
	<p class="block_2"></p>
	<p class="block_2">“Red! RUN!” Smoke tried to cover him so he could make a break for it.</p>
	<p class="block_2"></p>
	<p class="block_2">The Six foot <span class="text_3">fatass</span> dashed as fast as his shitty body could carry him. His knee screamed in pain as he did. He ran past the bodies of the injured, or those not fast enough to keep up. The main group had run well past where they were. Already making their way into the apartment complex. </p>
	<p class="block_2"></p>
	<p class="block_2">Another pod crashed hard right next to them. Red was acting on instinct at this point. He faced the pod and unloaded. Bullets sank into the creatures before they could even roll out of their confines. The stream of bullets kicked up <span class="text_3">(recoil)</span> and one hit one of the metal pipes. <span class="text_3">The pipe explodes.</span></p>
	<p class="block_3"></p>
	<p class="block_2">For Red everything went white. He couldn’t hear. He couldn’t see. He couldn’t think. He wished it would just stay this way. How many times would he have to keep failing before he was allowed to die. It was like sleep, peaceful, but it didn’t last.</p>
	<p class="block_2"></p>
	<p class="block_2">The acid smell of ammonia filled his lungs. His eyes shot open as he began coughing. Gunshots rang from above him as he regained consciousness.</p>
	<p class="block_2"></p>
	<p class="block_2">“And you said the fucking medkit were stupid you shit. Smelling salts motherfucker.”</p>
	<p class="block_2"></p>
	<p class="block_2">The strap from Red ‘s gun was around Bones’ waist. He had been dragging Red with him as he made his way to the apartment. Red watched Bones blast away at the creatures making their way towards them. They tried to group up but Bones threw a smoke grenade to disperse them. </p>
	<p class="block_2"></p>
	<p class="block_2">His eyes caught the pod. I must have exploded. The metallic device looked like it had been peeled open. Underneath he saw Jimmy the creatures must not have noticed him.</p>
	<p class="block_2"></p>
	<p class="block_2">Red could gather everything he had to stand. He did his best not to knock Bones over. Grabbing his pistol he was intent on pushing through. </p>
	<p class="block_2"></p>
	<p class="block_2">“Bones we gotta get Jimmy. He came back for me. I can’t just leave him.”<br class="calibre3"/> </p>
	<p class="block_2">He looked back at Bones. He could see it on his face. Even through the mask. He looked back and saw it. The shrapnel sticking out of Jimmy’s neck.</p>
	<p class="block_2"></p>
	<p class="block_2">He raised his pistol and screamed, firing into the crowd of monsters. It was their fault. It had to be. Because if it wasn’t theirs, then it would have been his. If he had just stopped shooting (<span class="text_3">or maybe not had the automatic thing)</span>. If he just stopped to think what might happen if he hit the pipes. Bones grabbed his shoulder and tore him backwards. </p>
	<p class="block_2"></p>
	<p class="block_2">“Red the apartment. Come on man.” All the while Bones was still picking off the creatures.</p>
	<p class="block_2"></p>
	<p class="block_2">It wasn’t far they would be able to make it. Red wasn’t going to bring another one of his friends down so he followed bones. </p>
	<p class="block_2"></p>
	<p class="block_2">They made a mad dash toward the structure. Two more pods crashed into the street behind them. Bones dashed forwards then turned to fire at the pods. He got a good hit and one of them exploded, taking the creatures with it. Red felt useless as he hobbled forward.</p>
	<p class="block_2"></p>
	<p class="block_2">The others smashed the glass on the front door. Red and Bones ducked in and made their way down the hall. A bullet nearly hit Red in the face. </p>
	<p class="block_2"></p>
	<p class="block_2">“DON’T SHOOT US ASSHOLE.” </p>
	<p class="block_2"></p>
	<p class="block_2">“Shit sorry.” The security guard was standing in the darkened hallway. The only light cloning from open doors. A crowd of people behind him were trying to make their way upstairs.</p>
	<p class="block_2"></p>
	<p class="block_2">“Why isn’t everyone already upstairs?” </p>
	<p class="block_2"></p>
	<p class="block_2">The guard kept his gun pointed down the hall. “Becuase its like herding fucking cat. Scared giant cats.” </p>
	<p class="block_2"></p>
	<p class="block_2">Red saw Marry making her way upstairs with the help of another survivor. Her side was bleeding profusely. </p>
	<p class="block_2"></p>
	<p class="block_2">“Marry, are you ok? Mary, I'm sorry. MARRY!” she couldn’t hear him over the crowd.</p>
	<p class="block_2"></p>
	<p class="block_2"><span class="calibre1">“Red not now we have shit to deal with. Bank boy, how  much ammo do you still have?”</span></p>
	<p class="block_2"></p>
	<p class="block_2">Before they could recoup, more of the creatures barreled down the hall. Momentary light filled the hallway as they fired at the creatures. Each round lighting up the hall before colliding into the flesh of their targets. Red’s big gun was empty so all he had was the pistol. It wasn’t going to last long. </p>
	<p class="block_2"></p>
	<p class="block_2">“Red throw your tear gas.” Bones yelled. </p>
	<p class="block_2"></p>
	<p class="block_2">The canister hissed as Red lobbed it towards the mass of creatures. Bones ran toward the stairs. Red and Guard followed. Red started to hear the creatures breaking windows. They would soon be pouring in. Bones was already halfway up the stairs when one burst through a window at the bottom. Red popped it in the head, but another was already pushing its body aside. Red had to push himself up the stairs. The pain in his knee almost got him killed. The guard kept shooting as they struggled to even make it to the second floor. Bones was already following the rest of the group farther up. </p>
	<p class="block_2"></p>
	<p class="block_2">Red Yelled up to Bones. “Bones just keep going.” </p>
	<p class="block_2"></p>
	<p class="block_2">“RED!” </p>
	<p class="block_2"></p>
	<p class="block_2">“JUST GO!” </p>
	<p class="block_2"></p>
	<p class="block_2">He took the door to the second floor hallway. Red gave that guard a confused look as he followed him in. Locking the door, Red prayed it would hold them off for even a second. </p>
	<p class="block_2"></p>
	<p class="block_2">“Why did you follow me?” Red asked the guard. </p>
	<p class="block_2"></p>
	<p class="block_2">“I Thought it was part of a plan or something.” </p>
	<p class="block_2"></p>
	<p class="block_2">“No, I’m just really bad with stairs.”</p>
	<p class="block_2"></p>
	<p class="block_2">“What?” </p>
	<p class="block_2"></p>
	<p class="block_2">Hands smashed the small window on the door grabbing at anything within reach. The pair backed away from the door.</p>
	<p class="block_2"></p>
	<p class="block_2">“So what was your name again?” </p>
	<p class="block_2"></p>
	<p class="block_2">“It’s Danny. </p>
	<p class="block_2"></p>
	<p class="block_2">“Good to meet you Dan, I'm Hank, you can call me Red if you like. Sorry we're about to die.”</p>
	<p class="block_2"></p>
	<p class="block_2">“Fuck off with that there is another staircase on the other side of the hall.”</p>
	<p class="block_2"></p>
	<p class="block_2">“Fine let’s keep trying then.” </p>
	<p class="block_2"></p>
	<p class="block_2">Aside from the little light coming through the door they just came through, the hallway was black. Red pulled out his flare gun and fired down the hall. The wave of orange light flew down the hall and hit the other door. Behind it more of the creature stirred. Now aware of their presence they began crashing against the pair's only other exit.</p>
	<p class="block_2"></p>
	<p class="block_2">The guard nodded his head. As if to say “<i class="calibre2">yeah that's about right.”</i><span class="calibre1">  </span></p>
	<p class="block_2"></p>
	<p class="block_2">“Ammo?” Red asked Dan. </p>
	<p class="block_2"></p>
	<p class="block_2">“I used the last of it on the stairs.”</p>
	<p class="block_2"></p>
	<p class="block_2">“Yeah me too. Oh! Wait, I still have some machine gun ammo.”</p>
	<p class="block_2"></p>
	<p class="block_2">“Really!”</p>
	<p class="block_2"></p>
	<p class="block_2">“Yep,” Red said, reaching into his pocket. He pulled out the four bullets left over from his second box. “Four whole bullets.” He loaded them into the gun then handed it to the guard. “Here”.</p>
	<p class="block_2"></p>
	<p class="block_2">“What about you?” </p>
	<p class="block_2"></p>
	<p class="block_2">Red pulled the sledgehammer from his back. “I’m good. I'm not really a very good shot anyway.” </p>
	<p class="block_2"></p>
	<p class="block_2">Light suddenly poured into the hallway. One of the apartment doors opened, a man peering out from behind. He looked to one side of the hall to see the horrid creatures about to break through the door at any second. Then turned his head to see Hank. A six foot tall man in riot gear covered in blood with a sledgehammer in his hands. The dim orange glow from behind him happened to be just bright enough to still see the horrifying visage of the clown mask.</p>
	<p class="block_2"></p>
	<p class="block_2">“AAAAAAAHHHHH” <span class="text_3">(guy from the apartment)</span><span class="calibre1">The man slammed his door back shut. Red and the guard exchanged looks of confusion. Then Red tried to kick the door in. He stumbled back after hearing his knee pop. “Uuuaahhhh Fuck ME!”. Using the sledgehammer, Red Smashed the lock instead.  The man screamed in the corner of his tiny one bedroom apartment. Too terrified to stop them. A window provided an almost blinding amount of light compared to the hallway.</span></p>
	<p class="block_2"></p>
	<p class="block_2">“Dan help me grab the bed we need to barricade the door.” Red yelled half limping into the room.</p>
	<p class="block_2"></p>
	<p class="block_2">They scrambled to throw anything they could against the wall. After the bed it was a table, and the chairs. The two looked around for more, but the apartment was not well furnished. </p>
	<p class="block_2"></p>
	<p class="block_2">“Is that it? Hey buddy we need more, or those things are going to get in here.” Red yelled at the man cowing in the corner. </p>
	<p class="block_2"></p>
	<p class="block_2">“I live alone, that's all I have.”</p>
	<p class="block_2"></p>
	<p class="block_2">“Do you at least have anything to defend yourself with, tools, maybe something heavy?”</p>
	<p class="block_2"></p>
	<p class="block_2">The man was crying as he went to his kitchen, and grabbed a knife. </p>
	<p class="block_2"></p>
	<p class="block_2">Hank was ready for this. To go out fighting. Though it was odd that it was here. He had dreamed it would be in a fight with the cops. Thomas had always survived in his mind. Hank would die in some ridiculous self sacrificing moment so that he could get away. Struggling not to tear up, Hank remembered this morning. How he could have told Thomas to just leave. He wished he could go back. So he could have stopped him. He would have given anything for it to have gone differently. </p>
	<p class="block_2"></p>
	<p class="block_2">“Hey,” Dan said to Hank. “I know this might not go down well, but I just wanted to say thanks.”</p>
	<p class="block_2"></p>
	<p class="block_2">“For what?”</p>
	<p class="block_2"></p>
	<p class="block_2">“For being in the wrong place at the right time. If it wasn't for you and your friends I'd be dead. Everyone in the bank would have been dead. I know you probably don’t give a shit, but even if we only made this much farther. I wanted you to know I appreciate that you at least tried to save us.”</p>
	<p class="block_2"></p>
	<p class="block_2">Hank stared back at the mask that Thomas had put on this morning. It was like it was him talking instead. Giving up would be so easy. It would make so much more sense. If he did that though, Thomas was going to be so disappointed in him. It would have made everything he had gone through pointless. It would have made all that Jimmy did meaningless. He had to try. He didn’t want to, but he had too. </p>
	<p class="block_2"></p>
	<p class="block_2">“Don’t worry Dan, we're still standing. Maybe we can at least pull enough away from the others, that they can survive.”</p>
	<p class="block_2"></p>
	<p class="block_2">Dan huffed back at him. “I wanna live too.” </p>
	<p class="block_2"></p>
	<p class="block_2">“Sure, we'll try for that too.”</p>
	<p class="block_2"></p>
	<p class="block_2">As they talked the creature spilled out into the hallway. They could hear them thrashing against the walls. Smashing the doors searching for their prey. </p>
	<p class="block_2"></p>
	<p class="block_2">Hank and Dan sat braced against the door. The man from the apartment was still trembling behind them with a knife in his hands. </p>
	<p class="block_2"></p>
	<p class="block_2"><span class="calibre1">Dan looked back at a  window. “Actually, we are only on the second floor what if we just-”</span></p>
	<p class="block_2"></p>
	<p class="block_2">The creatures were at the door. They threw themselves against it. Several grabbing hands wedged themselves in the door, prying it open. From the small opening one of the creature’s heads squeezed through. The oil from its skin stained the door and walls around it. The sounds of gnashing teeth and their wheezy howls filled the air.</p>
	<p class="block_2"></p>
	<p class="block_2"><span class="calibre1">Red tried to swing without  taking his weight off their makeshift barricade. The pile shifted back against him, but the iron head of the hammer still crashed against the creature’s face with a dull wet crack. It made a gurgling noise and recoiled back into the hallway. Though as soon as it did two more had already taken its place. </span></p>
	<p class="block_2"></p>
	<p class="block_2">Dan looked back at the man cowering. “Fucking help if you want to live asshole.” His words sadly are not enough to inspire movement from the poor bastard. </p>
	<p class="block_2"></p>
	<p class="block_2">An arm reaching out from the door almost gets close enough to grab Red's face. He swings again, breaking its arm, its bone sticking out of its flesh. Every time he has to swing the pile moves back <span class="text_3">(red swinging at the creatures that are breaking through with a sledgehammer)</span> It wasn’t going to hold. One of the oiled creatures slides its torso through the doorway. Red flinches as a gunshot goes off. More blood splatters against the wall mixing with black oil. It reels from the gun and thrashes wildly. An arm catching Red in the face. </p>
	<p class="block_2"></p>
	<p class="block_2">It felt so pathetic that one hit to the face was so debilitating. His thoughts just stopped for a second. He had to think about what was happening. Coughing on the blood now pouring out of his nose, he gasped for breath. Instinctively Red swung back at the damn thing. He caught the beast in its chest, but he pushed it right into the door. </p>
	<p class="block_2"></p>
	<p class="block_2">Another gunshot rang in Red’s ears. The door burst open. Red swung wild. He watched the creature hold back. Waiting to strike. Dan fired another shot. The creatures had no way to know that they only had one more bullet. The man in the corner screamed. In unison the beasts turned his direction. He tried to run to the bathroom, but the creatures poured down on him. One of them pinning him to the ground.</p>
	<p class="block_2"></p>
	<p class="block_2"><span class="calibre1"> A cloud of blood sprayed from one of the creature's faces as it was crushed in between the wall and Red’s hammer. Pulling back for another swing, Red was stopped as one of the creatures slammed him against the wall. It pulled back just enough to throw its arms against him. Red felt the wind leave his body. It was like being hit by a baseball bat. Blood spatter against Red’s face. The last bullet tore through the creature in front of him.  Dan was now pointing an empty gun at the creatures to try and get them to back away. On his other side Red watched in horror as the beast tore the apartment's tenant to pieces.</span></p>
	<p class="block_2"></p>
	<p class="block_2">Upstairs gunshots started up. The creatures around them flinched, not knowing where the sound was coming from. Several of them looked at the door. Then Dan yelled as one of them lashed it arm at him. It had knocked away the gun. Before they could jump him, Red screamed to get their attention. He dropped his hammer down on top of one of them close to him.</p>
	<p class="block_2">He knew what would happen next. Three of them jumped straight for Red. As one of them took him to the ground he grabbed onto it. If he held it tight, it couldn’t bite or hit him. He kept screaming. He wanted to keep their attention. Hoping that it might mean something. Maybe if he got their attention it would be enough to have helped Bones. Maybe Dan could escape. He just didn’t want it to mean nothing. </p>
	<p class="block_2"></p>
	<p class="block_2">He pulled out his knife and stabbed at the creature. It lifted its body and dropped down on Hank. He wondered if this is what it felt like when Thomas died crushed under the pile of these horrid things. Stabbing its face, Red continued to scream. His cries sounded more and more animalistic. Another creature bit his arm and tore him from underneath its companion. Hank could feel the blood trickling down his arm. He wasn’t done yet. He grabbed the creature's face with his free hand. Driving his fingers into its eyes. It let go of his arm and retreated. </p>
	<p class="block_2"></p>
	<p class="block_2">Hank stood up still screaming. The creatures were watching him. Hesitating to strike. Almost like they were afraid. He laughed.</p>
	<p class="block_2"></p>
	<p class="block_2">“Come on. What are you waiting for? Come on!” </p>
	<p class="block_2"></p>
	<p class="block_2">Red charged at them. Kicking one in the face. It whined, falling to the ground. It wasn’t just the one he kicked though. They had all stopped. Collapsing onto the ground the creatures were covering their face and writhing in what seemed to be pain. Red looked across the room and saw Dan standing there in just as much confusion. </p>
	<p class="block_2"></p>
	<p class="block_2">Red tried to call out to Dan, but he couldn’t hear his own voice. Instead his ears started ringing. He tried talking again, but there was still nothing. The ringing got louder. Hank tried walking over to Dan. His sense of balance had left him. He couldn’t stop himself from falling to the floor. It felt like the room was spinning. The ringing got louder and yet more muted. Like he was going deaf. He tried to look up, but everything was going white. He grabbed his head, or at least thought that he had. Everything was numb. He couldn’t feel anything. He didn’t even know if his eyes were still open. There was just a dull ringing, and nothing else. Hank felt his stomach lurched downwards. He wanted to vomit, but didn’t feel like he would be able to. He could feel heat. Like he had a fever. Was he falling? Was he still alive?</p>
	<p class="block_2"></p>
	<p class="block_2">It was like waking up. He couldn’t tell how much time had passed. He looked up at the ceiling. He was still in the apartment. His stomach lurched again. Hank rolled over and rushed to get his mask off before throwing up. His ears were still ringing. Hank tried to stand when he noticed one of the creatures. Most of them had left. Only a handful were still in the room. Only they were no longer hostile. </p>
	<p class="block_2"></p>
	<p class="block_2">He watched one of them lumber towards a cabinet, only to crash into it and fall over. Another was stumbling over corpses, barely able to stand. The last one was just lying down staring at him.</p>
	<p class="block_2"></p>
	<p class="block_2"></p>
	<p class="block_2">Hank looked around. He saw what was left of the tenant. He wished he could have done more for him. Dan groaned. Hank walked over to him. He seemed relatively uninjured. </p>
	<p class="block_2"></p>
	<p class="block_2">“Dan, Dan are you ok? Can you hear me? Dan? Dan?”</p>
	<p class="block_2"></p>
	<p class="block_2">“Hank, Hank is that you?”</p>
	<p class="block_2"></p>
	<p class="block_2">“Are you ok Dan?</p>
	<p class="block_2"></p>
	<p class="block_2">Dan rolled over, and dry heaved a couple of times before looking around.</p>
	<p class="block_2"></p>
	<p class="block_2">“I wouldn’t say that I’m ok, but I am still alive.” Dan looked in bewilderment at the creatures. “What the fuck happened?” </p>
	<p class="block_2"></p>
	<p class="block_2">“I don’t know, but we should try to find Bones and the others.” </p>
	<p class="block_2"></p>
	<p class="block_2">“Why aren’t we dead? What happened to the monsters?” </p>
	<p class="block_2"></p>
	<p class="block_2">“I don’t know. After, whatever the hell it was that just happened, they all stopped attacking.”</p>
	<p class="block_2"></p>
	<p class="block_2">Dan looked at the one lying down. It's head wobbled back and forth, like it was having trouble keeping it up. Then abruptly its head twitched responding to seemingly nothing. Trying to walk towards the direction, the creature only made it a couple steps before losing balance. It fell down and either gave up or stopped caring.</p>
	<p class="block_2"></p>
	<p class="block_2">“You think it’s safe? What if they attack again?” Dan said while struggling to stand.</p>
	<p class="block_2"></p>
	<p class="block_2">“If they do attack, we're dead. Better to leave while they’re like this.”</p>
	<p class="block_2"></p>
	<p class="block_2">They made their way out to the hall only to find more of the creatures wandering aimlessly. None of the things even seemed to notice them walking past. They just wandered aimlessly. They looked broken. It was almost more unsettling to watch them do nothing. When they got to the stairs, Hank watched one of the things falling down the steps badly injuring itself. It didn’t even seem to care. After hitting the bottom it just got back up and limped away.</p>
	<p class="block_2"></p>
	<p class="block_2">Hank groaned as they climbed up the floors. His knee was on fire. On top of that his head was still fuzzy. It made keeping balance difficult. </p>
	<p class="block_2"></p>
	<p class="block_2">“Come on Hank, I think I can hear people up there.”</p>
	<p class="block_2"></p>
	<p class="block_2">The now familiar sounds of confusion and suffering could be heard from above. Hank didn’t know whether to be relieved or worried about what he would see as he hobbled up the staircase. What little hope was left in him shrunk as they climbed past the first human corpse along the staircase. He just wanted what was left of his friends to be ok. The farther up they got the more bodies they found. As they got to the top floor a pile of dead creatures littered the staircase, but they could hear the voices of people just beyond that. They were forced to push past the things to get upstairs. Hank noticed the rotting creatures had an almost sickly sweet scent to them. If he had anything left in his stomach he would have thrown up again. </p>
	<p class="block_2"></p>
	<p class="block_2">At the top, Hank looked at the chaos. Even though the creatures had stopped, the panic had not. The hallway was so crowded with people Hank worried if he was actually going to be able to find Bones or Marry. </p>
	<p class="block_2"></p>
	<p class="block_2">A woman noticed the two and ran over their direction. “Did you come from downstairs? What's happening down there? Everyone just fell unconscious, and now the creatures aren’t attacking.”</p>
	<p class="block_2"></p>
	<p class="block_2">“We don’t know either,” Dan told her. “The same thing happened down there as well. We both blacked out. Now all the creatures are acting like they’ve been lobotomized.”</p>
	<p class="block_2"></p>
	<p class="block_2">“So those things are still down there?” </p>
	<p class="block_2"></p>
	<p class="block_2">“Yea, but they aren’t doing anything. They’re just wandering around.”</p>
	<p class="block_2"></p>
	<p class="block_2">“Hey,” Hank interrupted. “Where is Bones?”</p>
	<p class="block_2"></p>
	<p class="block_2">“Who?”</p>
	<p class="block_2"></p>
	<p class="block_2">“The other guy that looks like me. The one with the mask and gun.” </p>
	<p class="block_2"></p>
	<p class="block_2">“He went up to the roof.” </p>
	<p class="block_2"></p>
	<p class="block_2">He was alive. That was all Hank needed to hear. Dan stayed to try and get a handle on what was going on. Hank limped over to get to the roof as quickly as he could. Maybe Bones would have an idea of what to do, or at least know what happened to Marry. At the very least it meant that they hadn’t all been lost. </p>
	<p class="block_3"></p>
	<p class="block_2">As Hank opened the door he saw the ski. It was still dark, even darker now. You could tell the sun was still out, but just barely. There seemed to be a humming in the air. That or his head was still ringing from whatever had knocked him out. Bones was looking over the edge of the roof. His mask was off. A lit cigarette in his hand. </p>
	<p class="block_3"></p>
	<p class="block_2">“Bones, Bones are you ok?”</p>
	<p class="block_3"></p>
	<p class="block_2">He turned to Hank. His face was oddly placid. It felt out of place on him. Bones was always smiling even when he wasn’ supposed to be. </p>
	<p class="block_3"></p>
	<p class="block_2">“Hank, come look at this.”</p>
	<p class="block_3"></p>
	<p class="block_2">“What? Bones I’m alive, don't you care. Where's Marry? What are you going to do? We have to figure something out.” </p>
	<p class="block_3"></p>
	<p class="block_2">“Hank, just come over here.”</p>
	<p class="block_3"></p>
	<p class="block_2">Hank begrudgingly made his way over. </p>
	<p class="block_2"></p>
	<p class="block_2">“What the fuck is so important that you can’t even tell me-” </p>
	<p class="block_2"></p>
	<p class="block_2">Hank stopped as he looked over the edge. The streets were packed. The black slimy things shambled through the road in mass. All without purpose. There were so many Hank wondered how many people in the entire city had actually survived this mess.</p>
	<p class="block_2"></p>
	<p class="block_2">“Not that Hank. Look up there.” </p>
	<p class="block_2"></p>
	<p class="block_2">Bones' voice carried its worry with it. Hank looked up. There was a small opening in the clouds. At first it was hard to make out, but it was coming closer. Hank's heart nearly stopped. Something large and metal was flying above the clouds. Through the opening it looked more like a wall which meant whatever it was must have been much larger. It looked like something had scorched the wall where the opening in the clouds was. Like something had hit it.</p>
	<p class="block_2"></p>
	<p class="block_2">“Look at the pipe there by the opening.” Bones pointed with his finger. “Smoke is coming out of it. I think it's making the clouds.” </p>
	<p class="block_2"></p>
	<p class="block_2">If what Bones had said was true then whatever why flying over the city was also likely larger than it. Hank fell on his ass. He wasn’t sure if he would ever have the energy to get back up. </p>
	<p class="block_2"></p>
	<p class="block_2">“Bones, Bones what the fuck are we gonna do?”</p>
	<p class="block_2"></p>
	<p class="block_2">Bones laughed. It was just a little at first. Then he let it burst out. He sat there laughing while an enormous flying machine larger than a city flew above him. As he stopped he turned to Hank and shrugged. “Not much.”</p>
