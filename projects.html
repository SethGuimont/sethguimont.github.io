    <h2>Interactive Menu</h2>
    <p>This project connect a Flask app with a Postgres database and allows a restaurant owner to update the menu via API.</p>

    <h2>"It's Never Easy", Short story by my brother.</h2>
    <p>I was curious if I could embed a short story in my portfolio site for my brother, and I found a
    library called "bibi" which does this beautifully.  I make break this out into it's own site.</p>
    <p>For now the story can be found <a href="https://sethguimont.github.io/bibi/?book=its-never-easy">Here</a></p>
