      <h1>Some Projects</h1>
      <h2>Pershot Construction</h2>
      <p>Simple business website created for "Pershot construction", a privately owned construction company
      based in Sudbury ontario, this was done using a theme from "themewagon.com" and making some changes to
      override bootstrap elements.  I have this site hosted on Heroku and manage the site as well as the
      email addresses for the business.</p>
        <p>
            Link to the website is <a href="http://www.pershotconstruction.ca/">Here</a>
        </p>


    <h2>Form Finder</h2>
      <p>This site has several Python/Flask components, the program does the following</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Access an S3 bucket to display available forms</li>
        <li>Crawls Sites for either PDF for DOCX mental health forms</li>
        <li>Has a log in portal to access instruction for crawlers</li>
      </ul>
      <p>This is all a work in progress</p>
        <p>link to the repo is <a href="https://github.com/SethGuimont/MentalHealth">Here</a></p>

    <h2>IIF Site</h2>
    <p>This was a project that I did when I applied for a position at the Minneapolis Institute of Art.
    I included this here as it has some rudimentary automated testing done with Javascript based Selenium</p>
        <p>Link to the repo is <a href="https://github.com/SethGuimont/iif-image-site">Here</a></p>

    <h2>"It's Never Easy", Short story by my brother.</h2>
    <p>I was curious if I could embed a short story in my portfolio site for my brother, and I found a 
    library called "bibi" which does this beautifully.  I make break this out into it's own site.</p>
    <p>For now the story can be found <a href="https://sethguimont.github.io/bibi/?book=its-never-easy">Here</a></p>
